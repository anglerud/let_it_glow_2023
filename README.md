# Let it Glow calendar 2023

The [Let it Glow Maker Advent
Calendar](https://thepihut.com/products/maker-advent-calendar-let-it-glow-inc-raspberry-pi-pico-h)
from [The PiHut](https://thepihut.com/) is a Raspberry Pi Nano, and daily
components to entertain with some microcontroller and programming fun.

This repo follows the
[Guide](https://thepihut.com/pages/maker-advent-2023-guides).  My intention is
to do follow along in Python, and then Rust.
